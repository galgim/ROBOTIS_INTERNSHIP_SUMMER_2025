# ROBOTIS_INTERNSHIP_SUMMER_2025

<small>
Welcome to the official repository for the 2025 Summer Internship program in collaboration with ROBOTIS Inc.! This internship brings together students and robotics enthusiasts to develop cutting-edge robotic systems over the course of the summer.

**Duration:** June 2nd â€“ August 10th, 2025

**Project Overview:** Our main goal is to create an autonomous robotic crane capable of navigating and manipulating objects in a dynamic environment. This project involves hardware integration, ROS 2-based software development, and real-time control systems using ROBOTIS platforms such as DYNAMIXEL motors and the OpenManipulator X.
